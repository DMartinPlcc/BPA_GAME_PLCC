Archimedes
==========

A 2D Java game.

The purpose of this project is for entry into a national competition. 
If you yourself or project team are apart of such competition, or a competition in general - you and your team, business, or generalized entity are expressly prohibited from using code, systems methodology/structure, or other assets within this repository. Not only would doing so be unethical, but it would be grounds for disqualification.

If this project were a video game engine, or library, documentation in the form of extension and use would be appropriate.
However, this is a simple 2D Java game, and therefore has no intention of being used in, or a part of, a third party software or developer. 
Self documentation and the use of JavaDocs are the main crutch for new programmers wishing to extend upon, or alter our source project. 
Our code is free to use, and is in no way proprietary. 
However, we require to be  credited by those who use software, intellectual, or creative parts of this project in their own personal or commercial project. 
Please contact us if you wish to use the entirety, or parts of this project for a commercial use.
